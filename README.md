### About Astatine

The Minecraft JIRA page has a lot of bugs that have been reported, some of which have been open for years with an easy
fix!

Astatine aims to fix those bugs in the most efficient ways, without compromising the core game mechanics.

### Fixed bugs

- ``MC-132820``: Spawner isn't in the creative inventory
- ``MC-2474``: Transparent blocks (ie: snow) placed between bookshelves and enchantment tables negate bonuses received
  from bookshelves.
- ``MC-148998``: Items (specifically BlockItems) are offset in wandering trader's trading menu
- ``MC-127995``: You can use bone meal on sea pickles in situations where no sea pickles will grow

### Bugs to be fixed

- ``MC-115092``: Squid named "Dinnerbone" or "Grumm" is not
  upside-down [(#3)](https://github.com/dreamhopping/Astatine/issues/3)
